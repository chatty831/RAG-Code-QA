This is especially useful for big datasets to be able to shuffle properly, and also to enable fast parallel loading using a PyTorch DataLoader or in distributed setups for example. Shards are defined using datasets.Dataset.shard(): it simply slices the data without writing anything on disk.\n",
      "Get an datasets.IterableDataset from a map-style datasets.Dataset. This is equivalent to loading a dataset in streaming mode with datasets.load_dataset(), but much faster since the data is streamed from local files.\n",
      "Contrary to map-style datasets, iterable datasets are lazy and can only be iterated over (e.g. using a for loop). Since they are read sequentially in training loops, iterable datasets are much faster than map-style datasets. All the transformations applied to iterable datasets like filtering or processing are done on-the-fly when you start iterating over the dataset.\n",
      "Still, it is possible to shuffle an iterable dataset using datasets.IterableDataset.shuffle(). This is a fast approximate shuffling that works best if you have multiple shards and if you specify a buffer size that is big enough.\n",
      "To get the best speed performance, make sure your dataset doesn’t have an indices mapping. If this is the case, the data are not read contiguously, which can be slow sometimes. You can use ds = ds.flatten_indices() to write your dataset in contiguous chunks of data and have optimal speed before switching to an iterable dataset.\n",
